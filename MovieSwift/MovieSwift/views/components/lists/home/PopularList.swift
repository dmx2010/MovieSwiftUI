    //    and a global static instance, like the one in AppStore's static global?
    //    since this is not production code but a very good open source demo app, I would have to let
    //    this question go. since there are lot of places in this app that just use AppStore.global
    //    instead of using the @EnvironmentObject. we will have to wait for Apple detail documentation
    //    to understand why @EnvironmentObject is needed
